<div id='main'>After Galvanize, I would like to find an established company to work with that will allow me to continue my growth as a developer.  I also intend to work on personal projects of my own.  Many have told me that finding a project that you are passionate about is the most effective way to advance oneâ€™s skills.  Among other things, I intend to study either Java or Swift in order to create a music software controller application on either iOS or Android.  I may focus on the new and exciting DAW Bitwig that has an open-source API.  Being an independent, entrepreneurial person, I would ultimately like to start my own company and/or find a way to work remotely so I can settle in Barcelona for the rest of my days.</div>
